# Game (NOW WITH ALIENS!)

## 1. 
For the Creativity portion of the assignment, we added an alien to each room after the initial room.

The alien is constantly shooting vertically and horizontally, so if you step in those paths, you will lose the game.

When the rover steps, we check if the x/y coordinate is the x/y coordinate of the alien, meaning it is the crossfire of the alien's shooting.

## 2.
When the game ends (either rover dies or all tasks are copmlete), rover can no longer move.
